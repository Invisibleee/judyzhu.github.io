## Research Outlines


* ### Prompt Learning
  * Robustness and Generalization: explore and mitagate the neagtive impact of class imbalance in vision-language models [6]

* ### Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
  * Lable Space Mismatch: detect private label set in target domain [3]
  * Lable Shift: propose a unified theory and approach to solve label-heterogeneous domain adaptation [5]

* ### Domain Generalization
  * Heterogeneity: define and mitigate the heterogeneity in domain generalization [4] 

* ### Federated Learning
   * Adversarial Robustness: defence adversarial samples under federated scenario [1]
   * Personalization: personalization under clustered heterogeneity [2]
